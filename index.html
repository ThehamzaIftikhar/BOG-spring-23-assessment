            <p>Hi! My name is Hamza Iftikhar. I am a first year
                computer science major from Pakistan. Something I
                have been involved with for a very long time is my
                NGO "Bricks To Books". We find children who can't 
                afford school and are forced into child labor and 
                then sponsor their education. <b>Click the button below
